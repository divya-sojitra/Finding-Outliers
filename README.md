This project demonstrates methods for detecting outliers in a dataset using statistical techniques. It includes Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR) methods to identify extreme values.

**Features**  

**Outlier Detection Methods:**  
Z-score Method (uses mean and standard deviation)
IQR Method (calculates quartiles and fences)

**Data Visualization:**  
Histogram plotting to analyze data distribution

**Results**  
Identifies outliers using Z-score and IQR methods.
Provides threshold values and visualizations for better understanding.
